# Variables, Properties, and Data Types (Blocks)

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will examine a **pre-built MakeCode Arcade program** to learn how **variables** are used to control **sprite properties**.

You will also explore the difference between **number variables** and **text (string) variables**, and why using the correct variable type matters.

👉 When you see a **Canvas Prompt**, pause the tutorial and answer the question in your **Canvas assignment** before continuing.

## Step 1: Explore the Pre-Loaded Program

The blocks workspace already contains a complete program.

Take a moment to look at the blocks and notice:
- Several variables (`num1`, `numStr`, `num4`, and others)
- A sprite named **buffet**
- Blocks that set the sprite’s **position** and **velocity** using variables
